## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- JavaScript
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Responsive images
- Responsive Website

### What I learned

I start to learning about Grid. So, this is my first Implementation with this Layout Features. Such nice feelings ðŸ˜Š
```css
.what-is-it__row {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(151px, 1fr));
  grid-column-gap: 30px;
  grid-row-gap: 10px;
  list-style-type: none;
  margin: 0px 0px 80px 0px;
  @media (max-width: 955px) {
    grid-column-gap: 10px;
  }
}
```

I decided to find a solution for smooth transition between sections. And this manual to help me to do that. I don't wont to use a JQuery because it's just for one function, and don't need such a heavy Library like as JQuery.
```js
<script>
  const links = document.querySelectorAll(".hero__button");

  for (const link of links) {
    link.addEventListener("click", clickHandler);
  }

  function clickHandler(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    const href = this.getAttribute("href");
    const offsetTop = document.querySelector(href).offsetTop;

    scroll({
      top: offsetTop,
      behavior: "smooth"
    });
  }
</script>
```

### Continued development

I want to continue to learn a JavaScript. Currently, I'm working on Course from Udemy. App Brewery Web Developer Bootcamp. And to do practice, practice and practice one more ðŸ˜‰
